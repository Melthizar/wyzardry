WYZARDRY - Development Tracking

COMPLETED:
- Basic project structure setup
- Initial Pygame window implementation
- Grid class skeleton
- Player class skeleton
- Basic test framework

IN PROGRESS:
- Implementing grid drawing system
- Adding player movement controls
- Setting up collision detection

TODO:
1. Core Mechanics
   - Complete grid system implementation
   - Add player movement on grid
   - Implement turn system
   - Add basic collision detection

2. Graphics
   - Add proper sprite for player
   - Implement tile-based grid visualization
   - Add basic animations

3. Game Logic
   - Add game states (menu, playing, paused)
   - Implement basic combat system
   - Add simple AI for enemies

4. Testing
   - Expand grid tests
   - Add player movement tests
   - Add game state tests

NEXT STEPS:
1. Complete the draw_grid function in main.py
2. Implement player movement in Player class
3. Add grid position validation in Grid class

NOTES:
- Using Python 3.11+
- Pygame for graphics
- Grid-based movement (chess-style)
- Turn-based combat system planned

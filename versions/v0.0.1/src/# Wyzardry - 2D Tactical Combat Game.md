# Wyzardry - 2D Tactical Combat Game
**Version 0.1 - Initial Design**

## Overview
Wyzardry is a simple 2D tactical combat game focused on turn-based wizard battles.

## Phase 1 - Core Mechanics
- Simple 2D grid-based movement (like a chess board)
- Single player controls a wizard character
- Basic movement (up, down, left, right)
- Simple graphics using basic shapes/sprites
- Turn-based actions

## Technical Implementation
- Python 3.10+
- Pygame for 2D graphics and input handling
- Simple grid-based map system (start with 8x8)
- Basic player character represented by a colored square/sprite


## Dependencies
- pygame>=2.5.0
- pytest>=7.4.0
- black>=23.3.0

## Learning Goals
1. Basic Python syntax and concepts
2. VSCode usage and project organization
3. Simple game loop implementation
4. Basic graphics rendering
5. Handling user input

## Future Features (Phase 2+)
- Multiple characters
- Basic spells/combat
- Simple AI opponents
- Health/mana systems
- Different character classes

## Development Steps
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Create window and game loop
3. Implement grid system
4. Add player movement
5. Add turn system
